# CDP Project

## Overview
The **CDP Project** is a tool designed to streamline and automate workflows using Go and Docker. It leverages the simplicity and performance of Go for backend operations and Docker for containerized deployments.

## Features
- High-performance backend powered by Go.
- Docker-based containerization for easy deployment.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (version 20.10 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishnatrea/cdp.git
   cd cdp
   ```

2. Build the Go application:
   ```bash
   go build -o cdp
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cdp.
   ```

## Usage

### Running Locally
To run the application locally, use:
```bash
./cdp
```

### Running with Docker
To run the application in a Docker container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 cdp-project
```
This will make the application accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Configuration
All configurations are managed via the `.env` file located in the root directory. Update the file to suit your environment.

## Development

### Running Tests
To run the tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```
